# Bikeshare

This project analyzes usage data from a bikeshare service. The data is provided in CSV files and includes details such as:
- **When** users rented bikes (start time, end time)
- **Where** the rental and return occurred (start station, end station)
- **How** long each trip lasted

The goal is to extract insights about user behavior, such as:

Most popular stations
Average trip duration
Peak usage times
Weekday vs. weekend trends
